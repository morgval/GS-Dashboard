>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Create, read, update, and delete functions are common algorithms that occur in database management and HTTPS protocol.  The CRUD module could be adapted for other languages, but more importantly it is usable across many databases and would take little effort to adapt to other collections.  This ultimately saves time and money for engineers at companies like Global Rain.  I'd like to make a Javascript version of this to use throughout web development project in the future, or experiment with another project to possibly deploy my own database for tracking and storing robotic sensor information.

>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I've found problems are easiest to digest modularly.  Agile was a favorite subject to cover because the idea of grouping similar tasks into sprints made sense to me.  The process of creating the dashboard didn't begin with the dashboard, we had to set up the database so it was populated with data, then the next step was to implement the functions that would make the manipulation of the database possible in the first place.  We had to test said CRUD module before moving onto the dashboard.  Breaking this project down into steps helped focus on what the client actually needed from the system. 

>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I think computer scientists make using computers a lot easier for the general populace, and it matters because there are things computers can do that human minds simply can't.  I could sort through all this data and find the answers, and we could train everyone to learn how to set up a database in MongoDB, but there would be no opportunity to get any of the million of other things that go on in a company done.  Having access to a dashboard such as this, even to organize employee data, gives a company more control of their information and allows them to make better projections regarding future financial, technological, human resources and business decisions.
